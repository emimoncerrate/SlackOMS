# Phase 2: Slack Bot - Simple Guide 🤖

## What We're Doing (In Plain English)

Remember how you tested your API with that `curl` command? That worked, but it's technical and awkward.

**Phase 2 adds a friendly waiter (Slack bot)** so instead of:
```bash
curl -X POST https://slackoms-api.onrender.com/api/v1/trade \
  -H "X-API-Key: a8GKxzV6Sispbga2VuE0XvPOVdtRLcL5hNoiXTPflxQ" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"AAPL","quantity":50...}'
```

You can just type in Slack:
```
/trade AAPL 50
```

And a nice form pops up! ✨

## The Architecture (Restaurant Analogy)

```
YOU in Slack
    │
    │ Type: /trade AAPL 50
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Slack Bot (Waiter)    │ ← We're deploying this today!
│  - Takes your order     │
│  - Shows you a form     │
│  - Makes it look nice   │
└─────────────────────────┘
    │
    │ Calls API with proper format
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   OMS API (Kitchen)     │ ← Already deployed! ✅
│  - Executes trade       │
│  - Saves to database    │
│  - Returns confirmation │
└─────────────────────────┘
    │
    │ Returns success
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Slack Bot (Waiter)    │
│  - Formats nice message │
│  - Shows trade details  │
└─────────────────────────┘
    │
    │ Shows confirmation
    ↓
YOU see: "✅ Trade #T1234 executed!"
```

**You don't need to code anything!** Just deploy it.

### 2️⃣ Put Bot Code Online (10 min)  
- Go to Render (same place as your API)
- Tell it to run your `/slack-bot` folder
- Give it those 2 secret keys from Slack

**What you're doing**: Giving Slack your bot's phone number

## Time Breakdown

| Step | Time | What You're Doing |
|------|------|-------------------|
| 1. Create Slack App | 15 min | Clicking through Slack's website |
| 2. Deploy to Render | 10 min | Clicking through Render's website |
| 3. Connect URLs | 5 min | Copy-pasting 2 URLs into Slack |
| 4. Test | 5 min | Typing `/trade` in Slack |
| **TOTAL** | **~35 min** | All clicking, no coding! |

---

## Why It's Easy

1. **All code is written** - No programming needed
2. **Same process as Phase 1** - You've done this before with OMS API
3. **Just filling forms** - Clicking and copy-pasting
4. **Can't break Phase 1** - Your OMS API keeps working no matter what

## What Could Go Wrong? (And How to Fix)

### "Command /trade not found"
- **Problem**: Slack doesn't know about your bot yet
- **Fix**: Make sure you completed Step 1

### "Modal doesn't appear"
- **Problem**: Wrong URL in Slack settings
- **Fix**: Double-check Step 3

### "Invalid API Key" error
- **Problem**: Bot can't talk to your OMS API
- **Fix**: Check environment variables in Render

### "Bot is slow"
- **Problem**: Free tier sleeping
- **Fix**: Normal! First use takes 60 seconds
