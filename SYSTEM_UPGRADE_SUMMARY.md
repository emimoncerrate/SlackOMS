## 🎯 What You Need to Do Next

### **Option 1: Deploy to Render (Recommended)**

The new system needs updated deployment config. Here's what's needed:

1. **Update Render Configuration**
   - This system uses `app.py` as the main entry point (not `slack-bot/main.py`)
   - Uses FastAPI instead of Flask

2. **Environment Variables Needed**:
   ```
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
   SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token (if using Socket Mode)
   
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   
   # Alpaca (for multi-account)
   ALPACA_API_KEY=your-key
   ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
   ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
   ```

3. **Render Build Command**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Render Start Command**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

---

### **Option 2: Test Locally First**

```bash
cd /Users/emily/mybuilds/SlackOMS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Run locally
python app.py
```

## 🤔 Key Questions to Answer

1. **Do you want to use this advanced system or revert to our simple one?**
   - Advanced: More features, more complex
   - Simple: Easier to understand, less features

2. **Do you have Alpaca credentials?**
   - Needed for real trading simulation
   - Can work without, but won't execute real orders

3. **Do you want multi-account support?**
   - Each of your 5 team members can have their own Alpaca account
   - Or all share one account

---

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### **Immediate (Now):**
1. ✅ Channel restriction added
2. ✅ Modal title updated
3. ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub

### **Next (You Need To Do):**
4. **Check Render Dashboard**
   - See if auto-deploy started
   - Might fail because structure changed

5. **Update Render Start Command** to:
   ```
   uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
   ```

6. **Test in Slack**:
   - Try `/buy AAPL 10` in your trading channel
   - Should see "Emily's Trading Bot" modal

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Old `/trade` command won't work anymore** - it's now `/buy` and `/sell`
2. **This system is MUCH more sophisticated** - might be overkill for 5 people
3. **You may want to revert** if it's too complex (I can help with that)
